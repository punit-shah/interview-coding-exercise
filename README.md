Each of the functions implemented for this exercise (`delay`, `animateRight`, and `removeDuplicates`) can be found in [small-coding-exercise/functions.js](https://github.com/punit-shah/turnitin-coding-test/blob/main/src/small-coding-exercise/functions.js).

Additionally, a page was created to demonstrate each of the functions, which can be found at http://localhost:3000/small-coding-exercise once the server is running.

## Bigger coding exercise

The random dog app implemented for this exercise can be found at http://localhost:3000/bigger-coding-exercise once the server is running.

The app displays a random dog image, and links to 10 random dog pictures on the bottom, labeled by their breed.

The app was built with vanilla JavaScript in the interest of time and simplicity.
